# Contributing to InterpretML

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

## Developer certificate of origin
Contributions require you to sign a _developer certificate of origin_ (DCO) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://developercertificate.org/.

When you submit a pull request, a DCO-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a DCO and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our DCO.
